# BankingApp

BankingApp is a simple Java-based console application that simulates basic banking operations, including user sign-up, login, deposit, withdrawal, and transaction history tracking. This project is designed to demonstrate core Java programming skills, file handling, and basic OOP principles.

## Features

- **User Sign-up and Login:** Allows new users to register with a username, password, and initial balance.
- **Secure Login:** Validates credentials to ensure only registered users can access their accounts.
- **Deposit & Withdraw:** Users can deposit or withdraw funds, with updated balances.
- **Transaction History:** Maintains a record of each user's deposits and withdrawals.
